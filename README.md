### Supplement Website

I chose to remake this website because it has a clean minimal appearance and opportunities to leverage pseudo elements for styling and advanced positioningâ€”skills I wanted to further develop. I created the unordered lists using pseudo elements. The checkmarks use data URIs with a base64 encoded image. I leveraged CSS positioning for the white container that sits over the image. It has a CSS box shadow to add dimension. The website is responsive using Bootstrap for the grid.
